# Overview

In this project, I am going to learn how to coorperate Python and Pandas by using VS Code. My goal of doing this project is to learn the syntax of Pandas and basic functions, for example, loading and saving data, sorting data, and filtering data.

Here is the website where I got the dataset:

In this project, I used Python and Pandas to analyze the cost of insurance among a group of people. I did research and got a dataset of Personal Medical Cost from Kaggle. The purpose of this analysis is to find out if the BMI and smoking would affect the cost of insurance and the cost difference between males and females. Using the data, I first focus on the group of 18 years old interviewees. So, I filtered out those are not 18 years old and sorted the data by there BMI. Then, I seperate the data into four groups and plot the data into a graph.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

Questions:

1. Would smoking and BMI affect the cost of the insurance?
2. Would gender affect the cost of the insurance?

Answers:

1. From the graph, we could easily tell that those who smoke pay more expensive insurance than those who don't smoke. The smokers pay almost 2-3 times of the non-smokers. Before lloking at the data, I assume that those who has unstable BMI would pay more. But by looking at the non-smokers and comparing their BMI and cost, we can see that the BMI has no effect on the cost of insurance for both the smokers and non-smokers. In conclusion, the smoking habit would affect the cost of insurance while the BMI would not.
2. Comparing the males and females, we could see that the red graph (the female smokers) is really close to the orange graph (the male smokers) while the green graph (the female non-smokers) is really close to the blue graph (the male non-smokers) too. In summary, we could say that the gender would not affect the cosst of insurance.

# Future Work

- I think could have done better on gathering the data. I think comparing how ages would affect the cost would be a better analysis than the gender.
- I think I could analyze how the family size would affect the cost of insurance in the future.
- I could do better on the coding. I think I should do it more efficiently. I should practice more on the syntax and find a better way on coding.
