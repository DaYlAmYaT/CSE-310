# Overview

In this project, I did a Tic-Tac-Toe game. It allows me to learn to sytax of the language, Rust. It also, allows me to get more familiar to the difference between String and &str, mutable and immutable, and handling errors.

# Future Work

- I could focus more on the quality of the code. Now, the code is not efficient enough.
- Instead of using array to hold all the prompts, I could us vector to hold them.
- In the future, I could build more code on checking who wins the game or if it's a tie.
