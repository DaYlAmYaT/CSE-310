# Overview

This is a simple family tree. It can demonstrate the variables, condition, loop, methods, classes, and data structure. In this project, we could add members into the 'tree'. Also, we could show the info of the members. When we are done editing, we could end the program (loop) by typing 0.

Here is the demonstration: [Software Demo Video](https://youtu.be/y_ueDlRcIDU)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- More options to edit the tree (e.g. remove person, edit info)
- Instead of using ArrayList, using TreeSet might be more suitable
- Could set up more classes like Tree/Family to gather the Person classes
