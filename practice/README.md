# Overview

In this project, I decided to make a day planner. I hope I could gain more about how languages cooperate together, and how I could import library to benefit the project.

As mentioned, this project is a day planner mobile app. It allows users to add events to the planner at a time. After pressing the + button, the event will be shown in the planner. I created this app so that the users could keep track of their plan of the day to avoid missing the events and spend the day more efficiently.

# Development Environment

- VS Code
- Python 3.9
- GitHib
- React Native
- Expo Go

# Useful Websites

- [Visual Studio Code & GitHub](http://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol)
- [Python 3.9 Pref Manual](http://docs.python.org/3.9/library/index.html)

# Future Work

- Right now, the time for the events can only be a certain time. Hopefully, I could handle more specific times.
- The variables in the project could have been dealed better with useState. I hope I could do better and use it in the future
- Because the events are shown by changing the default empty Text to the event names. I hope I could handle adding elements into the View instead
